 *  This command-line utility adds one license at a time to unflattened disk images.
 *  It's meant to be used inside build scripts.
 *
 *  Usage: AddLicense /path/to/TheUnflattened.dmg Language /path/to/TheLicense.rtf
 *
 *  The language parameter can be either short (en) or long (English) form.
 *  The strings for each language are inside the license.plist file.
 *  There must be one number and 9 strings for every language; the number is the output string
 *  encoding (kTextEncodingMacXYZ in TextCommon.h). The string group is actually indexed
 *  by the ISO short language name. All strings are converted to the encoding
 *  specified; usually this should be MacRoman.
 *
 *  This should run on 10.5 and up.
